\section{Scoring}\label{sec:scoring}
When a player closes their hand by completing their final meld, they reveal it for scrutiny. 
If the hand has been deemed valid by the other players, the game will end immediately, and the scoring begins.

To score, the victor simply adds up all the pips for all the other players' incomplete melds.

However, before scoring can occur, all the other players have the opportunity to reduce the victor's point total by attempting to shed any of their un-melded dominoes by trying to attach them to the victor's melds.
Once the other players are satisfied, the victor may begin to count up their score.

\paragraph{Example}
Anna closed her hand, revealing\\
{ \domino%
    ^5^6^7^8\hspace{2mm}^6^5^4\hspace{2mm}^1^2^3^4\\%
    v9v9v9v9\hspace{2mm}v0v1v2\hspace{2mm}v0v0v0v0
}\vspace{1mm}\\
\vspace{1mm}Bob's unfinished melds contained\\
{ \domino%
    ^9\hspace{2mm}^7\hspace{2mm}^5\hspace{2mm}^2\hspace{2mm}^3\\%
    ^9\hspace{2mm}^7\hspace{2mm}^0\hspace{2mm}^6\hspace{2mm}^6
}\vspace{1mm}\\
