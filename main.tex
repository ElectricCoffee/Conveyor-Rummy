\section*{Intro}
Conveyor Rummy is played with dominoes, where the numbers on the tiles serve as both suits and ranks. 
Unlike traditional playing cards or Rummy tiles, the dominoes allow for a more dynamic and flexible gameplay experience. 
With the ability to adapt to your hand's composition seamlessly, you'll be able to strategically outmaneuver your opponents and dominate the game.
