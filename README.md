# Conveyor Rummy &beta;1.1.0
A Rummy-like game for 2-4 players played entirely with dominoes.
Over a series of turns, players draw tiles from a number of columns&mdash;or "conveyors", trying to complete sets and runs&mdash;called _melds_.
Whoever gets rid of all their dominoes first wins the round. 
Whoever has the most points at the end of the game wins.
