\section{Requirements}
\begin{itemize}
    \item A double-9\footnote{If you are unfamiliar with this terminology: ``double-9'' and ``double-12'' simply means that the largest tile in the set is a 9--9 or a 12--12} set of 55 dominoes (2 players)
    \item A double-12 set of 91 dominoes (3-4 players)
    \item Domino stands/racks (optional, but recommended)
    \item A way to keep score---pen and paper is fine
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Aside} Unfortunately in our play-testing, a double-6 set made for extremely quick games, even with just two players. Rounds would be over in just one or two turns. If this is fine with you, do not hesitate to play this variant.
